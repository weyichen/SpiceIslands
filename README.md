Spice Islands
=============

Outline
-------
A turn-based, multiplayer strategy game in which multiple players compete to exploit the exotic resources of an archipelago within a fixed number of turns. All players start out in the same position on the map, which is a neutral zone. At first, the rest of the map is concealed by “fog of war.” Players must venture out into the high seas to explore the archipelago for resources that can be acquired and traded. Only spices can be sold for money, and the richest player wins at the end of the game, but other resources can help you collect spices more efficiently or thwart your rivals.

Specific goals
-------
- 2-5 players can play together sitting side-by-side and each taking turns, or have matches over the internet.
- Randomly generate a new map with different geographical features and distribution of resources for every new game.
- Character model and geographical feature graphics will be done using sprites.
