CIS 192 Project Proposal
=======================

Team members: Anand Sundaram, Yichen Wei

Project Title: Spice Islands

Github Repository: https://github.com/weyichen/SpiceIslands

Outline
--------

A turn-based, multiplayer strategy game in which multiple players compete to exploit the exotic resources of an archipelago within a fixed number of turns. All players start out in the same position on the map, which is a neutral zone. At first, the rest of the map is concealed by “fog of war.” Players must venture out into the high seas to explore the archipelago for resources that can be acquired and traded. Only spices can be sold for money, and the richest player wins at the end of the game, but other resources can help you collect spices more efficiently or thwart your rivals.

Specific goals
---------------
- 2-5 players can play together sitting side-by-side and each taking turns, or have matches over the internet.
- Randomly generate a new map with different geographical features and distribution of resources for every new game.
- Character model and geographical feature graphics will be done using sprites.

Division of labor
----------------
Since there are only 2 group members and neither of us is specialized in any particular area of Python, we will not be designating any division of labor in the beginning, and simply learn and work on what is needed at the moment. If necessary, we will figure out an equitable distribution of labor later.

Packages:
--------
pygame
flask
requests
